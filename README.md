# SPAC (Single Page App - Comic) #
This is my attempt at creating a simple and lightweight webcomic single page app for my webcomic "Zero-25".

* ### Goals ###
I needed a few things:

	* A site for my webcomic (because can it really be called a webcomic if its not on the web?)

	* Hand-made code examples to prove to people I can do the things

	* An excuse to work with some of the more current / popular frameworks 

* ### The Stack ###
Here's what I've decided to use:

	* Flask

	* Flask-SQLAlchemy

	* React
